# My finale project for CS50G

---

## Description

As a finale project i created level using unity engine from my favorite childhood game "Shadow the hedghehog". Especialy i was working on implementing all mecanics that i liked the most as a child.

### What i did and why i am proud of it

 - **Running on loop.** If the character runs fast enough, he will be able to overcome the 360 degree loop. If the character stops while running in a loop, he will fall due to gravity

 - **Fast movement along the rings.** If a character approaches the ring and presses the "X" button, he will move along the line of rings as it was done in the original version of the game

 - **Dash Panel.** The game has a speed panel. When a character steps on it, he accelerates in the direction the panel rotates.

 - **Enemies.** There are enemies in the game. They attack the character when he approaches them.

 - **Sounds.** The game has the sound of picking up a ring, bouncing on a spring, accelerating on the acceleration panel, shooting and reloading, as well as background music

 - **Animations.** The player and enemies have animations. The player has animations of inaction, walking, running, jumping, shooting, taking damage. The enemy has animations for idle, moving and attacking.

 - **Shooting.** The character has a weapon. If you press the "Z" button, it will shoot in the direction you are looking. If the bullet hits an enemy, the enemie will disappear.

 - **Damage and Death.** If the player receives damage from an enemy, he loses some of the rings. If there are no rings, the character dies.

 - **Attack.** If the player is close to an enemy, he can attack him with double jump.

While my project has something in common from other project that were in this course such as GUI as in "Helicopter 3d" or character movement like in "Dreadhols" or gun shooting like in "Portal". But even this mecanics are slightly diffrent. For example  project has third person controller with rotating camera focused on hero while in "dreadhalls" there was first person controller.And in Portal the gun didnt had projectiles on shoot and didnt had enemies that interact with enemies. All the mecanics that i named above i implemented by myself and they were in no other game that was taught in this course.
